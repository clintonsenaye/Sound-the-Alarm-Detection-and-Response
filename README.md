<h2>Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response</h2>

During this course, I honed skills pivotal to effective incident response, from verifying threats to handling post-incident phases. I immersed myself in the incident lifecycle, grasped team dynamics, and mastered essential documentation tools. An in-depth exploration of network analysis and packet sniffing tools enabled me to proactively detect and respond to threats through traffic analysis. Notably, I became proficient in crafting filtering commands and interpreting captured packets to uncover malicious activities. I delved into the incident detection, investigation, and analysis stages, demonstrating expertise in artifact investigations, chronology mapping, and evidence-based decision-making. My expertise extended to containment, eradication, and recovery strategies, culminating in a detailed comprehension of post-incident procedures.

Furthermore, I delved into the crucial role of logs within intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information event management (SIEM) systems. I gained proficiency in creating IDS rules and interpreting their syntax for alerts. Familiarity with SIEM tools empowered me to extract, normalize, and analyze log data, employing queries for thorough incident investigation. My multifaceted training equips me with a holistic understanding of incident response, network analysis, and log management, positioning me as an adept security analyst ready to safeguard against evolving threats.

Project Activity : Document an incident with an incident handler's journal

<h4>Project Description:</h4>

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.
